First question is about constructing a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm and entropy, exploring the GINI index, also illustrated how training and test errors change with different pruning thresholds for a balanced dataset.
Second question is about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Image Classification. I've implemented a CNN to classify monkey images, trained it for 100 epochs with SGD and tuned hyperparameters. Compared this with training using Adam optimizer and experimented with transfer learning using a pretrained ResNet18 model. Plots are created to show training/validation loss and accuracy for each training scenario.
